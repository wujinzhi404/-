## ✒️ Preface: Why Do We Tear Each Other Apart—Yet Sink Together?

We often wonder:

Why, despite our overwhelming numbers, are we always ruled by a few?

Why do ordinary people constantly argue among themselves—while staying silent toward real oppressors?

Why do you feel exhausted, lonely, and powerless, while *they* remain safe and in control, generation after generation?

The answer has always been right in front of us:

**Division**—is the ultimate weapon the few use to rule the many.

They manufacture conflict so you come to believe:

> * Men are enemies of women;
> * Outsiders are stealing jobs from locals;
> * The poor are lazy, the rich are smart;
> * Leftists are lunatics, rightists are fascists...

While we waste our energy attacking one another, the true holders of power and wealth sit back and enjoy the show—cutting an ever-shrinking pie into more pieces for themselves.

This book is not a rant—it’s a scalpel.

We will peel back the layers of *division*—exposing the methods that have turned us against each other and kept us silent.

You don’t need to be a hero.
You don’t need to shout slogans.
You just need to see clearly—
**and then choose what you want to do next.**
